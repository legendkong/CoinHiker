## Notes
The main focus of this project is to display the execution of workflow each time somebody commits a change via the use of *GitHub Actions' CI/CD*. <br>
  
  
## Main Application 
  
Using python, I created a telegram bot that allows the user to receive real time stock data(latest 5 minutes) of their desired stock by typing <ins>*price {ticker symbol}*</ins>.<br>

  </p>
  <br><br>
The user is also able to retrieve the stock data of their top 3 stock picks(implemented within the code itself) just by typing a simple <ins>/wsb</ins> command.

  <em>In this case, stock ticker symbol "TSLA", "NIO" and "PLTR" are the user's favourite stock picks.</em>
